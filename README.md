## Overview

Hatch was envisioned as a supportive companion for individuals experiencing anxiety episodes. The app helps users track emotional events, log personal remedies, and reflect on their progress through gentle journaling prompts and breathing exercises.

Beyond immediate relief, Hatch encourages post-episode reflection and pattern recognition, empowering both individuals and specialists to identify recurring triggers and growth patterns.
